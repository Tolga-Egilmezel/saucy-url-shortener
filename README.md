# saucy-url-shortener


## Installation

$ npm i

For Test

```
$ node index.js
```

That's just have hash code generate with post URL. Need to check has code from db folder. /url/{hash} will redirect. But not a perfect code that I ever write :)

### Missings
 - I'm not familiar with DB systems like MongoDB or NoSQL. So I use local storage. It's took my 45 min to figure out as DB systems. DB needed
 - No time any css or design
 - No time for unit test
 - No time for using library like VueJS or AngularJS
